A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a type of web application that combines the best features of web and mobile apps. Here are the key characteristics and benefits of PWAs:

1. **Progressive**: Works for every user, regardless of browser choice because they’re built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.
2. **Responsive**: Fits any form factor, whether it’s desktop, mobile, or tablet.
3. **Connectivity Independent**: Works offline or on low-quality networks using service workers.
4. **App-like**: Feels like an app to the user with app-style interactions and navigation.
5. **Fresh**: Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.
6. **Safe**: Served via HTTPS to ensure content hasn’t been tampered with.
7. **Discoverable**: Can be found on search engines because they are websites.
8. **Re-engageable**: Makes re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.
9. **Installable**: Users can add them to their home screen without the hassle of app stores.
10. **Linkable**: Easily shared via URL and doesn't require complex installation.

By leveraging modern web capabilities, PWAs offer a seamless and engaging user experience, making them a popular choice for developers aiming to provide app-like functionality through a web interface.
